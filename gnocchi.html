    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>½ onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 ½ (14.5 ounce) cans passata (crushed tomatoes)</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
        <li>1 (18 ounce) package potato gnocchi</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1 (4 ounce) ball fresh mozzarella, cubed</li>
        <li>4 fresh basil leaves</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Step-by-Step</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat; cook onion until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add passata and salt; simmer over low heat while you prepare the gnocchi. </li>
        <br>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook gnocchi in the boiling water until they float to the top, 2 to 4 minutes. Drain. </li>
        <br>
        <li>Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. </li>
        <br>
        <li>Pour 1 ladle of tomato sauce into the bottom of a baking dish. Add gnocchi, remaining tomato sauce, and Parmesan cheese; toss to combine. Arrange cubes of mozzarella cheese evenly on top. </li>
        <br>
        <li>Place baking dish in the oven and broil until mozzarella cheese is melted and sauce has slightly reduced, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove from oven and garnish with basil leaves before serving. </li>
